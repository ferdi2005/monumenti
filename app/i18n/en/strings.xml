    <string name="infocors">Wiki Loves Monuments is an international contest that aims to illustrate Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects through photographs of cultural heritage taken by citizens themselves, thus being also a great opportunity for tourism promotion.\nIt was born in 2010 and is organized annually around the world, in more than 50 countries, from 1 to 30 September.\In 2012 it entered the Guinness Book of Records as the largest photo contest in the world. Each year, more than 130,000 photographs are uploaded.\nThe subject of the images allowed to participate in the competition are monuments, a very broad set that includes buildings, sculptures, archaeological sites, architectural structures but also natural sites and landscape assets. All photographs are released under a free license and published on Wikimedia Commons, the large database that illustrates Wikipedia (the 5th most visited site in Italy) and all other projects with multimedia content (photos and videos). \nWiki Loves Monuments is open to the participation of everyone, professional photographers or amateurs, with no age limit. \nThe Italian edition is organized since 2012 by Wikimedia Italia, an association that has been working since 2005 to spread knowledge and free culture in Italy, as a chapter of Wikimedia Foundation.</string>
